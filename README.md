## A weather application built in Nodejs and ExpressJs to see current weather of the location entered by user.
### Shows City, Country, Weather Information, Current temperature, maximum and minimum temperature recorded.
### You can see this live on : https://weather-checker-z34y.onrender.com/
#### You can see that .env and NodeModules are in gitignore, so in order to clone it you have to install NodeModules and create .env fie.
